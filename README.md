# Principles-of-microprocessor-systems
This repository is based on the laboratories for the subject Principles of microprocessor systems at Warsaw University of Technology.
The "Principles of microprocessor systems" course is dedicated to people who have at least little experience in programming microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino board) or know the basics of electronics. The course can be carried out on the free simulIDE simulator or using any ATmega32 board (the list of necessary elements is below).
During the course, programs are written in the C language.
